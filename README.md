# CSCI-331-Assignments
A repository for all of my assignments and projects in CSCI 331 (Web Development)

Assignment 1: Write a basic html page that displays information about me

Assignment 2: Make a basic website using both html and css

Assignment 3: Write a javascript program that simulates a password strength program

Assignment 4: Make a website using html, css, and javascript that converts temperatures between fahrenheit and celsius

Assignment 5: Make a website that collects user input in a form using the radio, checkbox, select, multiselect, and text input types, and sends the key-value pairs to a php form viewer that displays them in a CSS styled table. For this assignment, I decided to get creative and create an algebraic structure detector. If the user inputs correspond to a particular algebraic structure like a group, ring, or field, I alert the user in the php page.
